## üìä What is Audio Hijack?  

**Audio Hijack** is a powerful macOS application for capturing, recording, and processing audio from virtually any source.  
It provides a visual block-based routing interface where users can chain inputs, processors, and outputs to build custom audio workflows without needing deep technical knowledge.

At its core, Audio Hijack makes it trivial to capture audio from apps (like web browsers or music players), hardware inputs (microphones, mixers), or system audio.  
You can apply processors ‚Äî EQ, compression, reverb, noise reduction ‚Äî in real time, record to high-quality formats, and stream or pipe audio to other applications and services.

The app scales from simple tasks (record a Skype call) to advanced setups (multi-channel podcast capture, live streaming with per-source effects, or archival recordings).  
Key strengths include robust scheduling, session templates, and automatic file naming ‚Äî all aimed at making repeatable recording tasks painless.

Audio Hijack also includes features for quality assurance and flexibility:
- Live monitoring with low-latency playback.  
- Per-source volume sliders and input meters for precise level control.  
- Automatic splitting of recordings by time or silence detection.  
- File format options and metadata tagging for smooth post-production.  
- Session templates and presets to get started quickly or to standardize workflows across projects.

Whether you‚Äôre producing podcasts, capturing interviews, archiving broadcasts, ripping audio from streaming apps, or building complex live setups, Audio Hijack combines professional features with an approachable UI to get the job done.
